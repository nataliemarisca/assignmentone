Assignment 1

Natalie Anggawidjaja

The purpose of this first assignment is to conduct a research on the web-accessibility and SEO on five museums.

The five museums I have decided to look at are:
1) Hammer Museum, https://hammer.ucla.edu/visit , Accessibility (96) , SEO (83)
2) Fowler Museum at UCLA, https://fowler.ucla.edu/ , Accessibility (84) , SEO (83)
3) Santa Monica History Museum, https://santamonicahistory.org/exhibits/ , Accessibility (74) , SEO (100)
4) James Bond 007 Museum, http://www.007museum.com/ , Accessibility (56) , SEO (80)
5) Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum, https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/ , Accessibility (97) , SEO (75)

Summary of finding: From this research, I have learned about the different levels and statuses of museums' websites based on their accessibility score
and SEO score. I learned how to use the Google Chrome lighthouse function to obtain accessibility and SEO scores. I was also able to be exposed to some
ways to improve the accessibility of the web-app by reading through the lighthouse summary.
